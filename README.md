## Demo

https://maxfadet.github.io/personal-homepage/

## Description:

This project is a dynamic CV website designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my skills, projects, and contact details. The site features a dark/light mode toggle, an error handling mechanism for project loading, and a responsive layout to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What it looks like:

</div>

## Features:

### Theme Switching:
- Users can toggle between light and dark themes using a custom theme switcher.
### Project Display: 
- The project section dynamically fetches and displays a list of projects from GitHub. It includes error handling and a loading state.
### Responsive Design: 
- The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including tablets and phones.
### Show More/Show Less Functionality:
- Expand or collapse the list of projects with a button click. Hidden projects are blurred to maintain focus on visible content. The blur effect is applied to projects when they are not currently shown.
### Skills Section:
- Highlights current skills and future learning goals.
### Contact Information: 
- Provides contact details and social media links for networking and job opportunities.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
